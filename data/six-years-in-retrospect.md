Today, I have worked full six years since I started at Metamarkets May 14, 2012 in PST (I am in KST now). I believe I have come a long way as an engineer, and, more importantly, as a human being. I am grateful for those who have given me chances before I have proven myself, and those who have forgiven me for my screw-ups.

* First year (2012-2013), I learned how to code properly as a software engineer. I took pride in coding many lines of code fast, and enjoyed setting up a Jenkins.
* Second year (2013-2014), I learned the basic building blocks of data visualization, and went to my first Jenkins conference.
* Third year (2014-2015), I rolled out a user-facing project using feature flags without impacting customers, and started learning how to manage a team.
* Fourth year (2015-2016), I learned how to communicate a company-wide crisis (down-sizing) and keep the team together.
* Fifth year (2016-2017), I recruited aggressively, and saw how a poor project management destroy a team. I also started following industry news closely.
* Sixth year (2017-2018), I started developing a deeper understanding of Typescript, React, and Redux. I also started a local meetup for fellow managers at startups.

There were ups and downs, but mostly ups thank to the supporters around me.

I hope my next 6 years are as full of valuable lessons as the last 6 years.
