During a recent discussion with my friend, he asked me what I was looking for with my next move. At the time, I had a list of companies I wanted to work at, but did not extract what qualities made me excited about those opportunities. So I rambled a bit which led my friend to say that I was still unclear what I was looking for.

That conversation got me thinking from time to time, and I finally distilled the two qualities. I am looking for an opportunity:

1.  To make a lasting impact at a lasting business

    During my time at Metamarkets, a big data analysis startup acquired by Snapchat in 2017, I had a lot of fun, working on interesting problems with very smart, technical people. I left Metamarkets after four years, and a year later, the team faced a tricky business position, and eventually decided to sell the company.

    I was hurt, but that was not because I lost some money in that sale but because the work we put in all those years failed to actualize a meaningful business. Then and there I realized how hard it is to create a lasting impact that persists many years after you leave and that you need a right business environment for your work to mean something.

2.  To solve unfamiliar problems (either people-side or technical-side)

    Even though two companies I worked at have very different business models (enterprise saas, and ad-supported social network), both team had 10~15 engineers, and about 30 total head counts, and both web products had around a few thousand active users. And the problems start looking familiar, maybe too familiar, to me: how to incorporate tech debts into scheduling, how to recruit talents, how to test integration, and so on. I know I have miles to go before I get really good at solving these problems, but I want to experience different sets of challenges and see if I enjoy solving them more than the ones I have seen.

So those two are my criteria. In short, I am looking for companies in different stages and making sure I like not just the tech but also the business. Thank you my friend for prompting this post. Writing this post brought me much needed clarity.
