During a recent discussion with my friend, he asked me what I was looking for with my next move. At the time, I had a list of companies I wanted to work at, but did not extract what qualities made me excited about those opportunities. So I rambled a bit which led my friend to say that I was still unclear about what I was looking for.

That conversation got me thinking for some time, and I finally distilled the two qualities. In short, I am looking for an opportunity:

1.  To make a lasting impact at a lasting business

    During my time at Metamarkets, a big data analysis startup acquired by Snapchat in 2017, I had a lot of fun working on interesting problems with very smart people. I left Metamarkets after four years, and a year later, the team faced a tough business environment, and eventually sold the company at a price lower than the value before I joined.

    I was hurt, but not because I lost money but because the work we put in failed to create and sustain a meaningful business. Then and there I realized how hard it is to create a lasting impact that lasts years after you leave and that you need a right business model for your work to mean something.

2.  To solve unfamiliar problems (either people-side or technical-side)

    Even though two companies I worked at have very different business models (enterprise saas, and ad-supported social network), both team had 10~15 engineers, and about 30 total employees, and both web products had around a few thousand active users. And the problems start to look old: how to deal with tech debts, how to recruit talents, how to test integrations, and so on. I know I have miles to go before I get really good at solving these problems, but I want to experience different sets of challenges and to see if I enjoy solving them more than the ones I have seen.

So those two are my criteria. In short, I am looking for a company in a different stage with a business model that I believe can scale. Writing this post brought me much needed clarity.
