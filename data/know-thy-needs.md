During July MTable meetup with fellow managers, I learned a useful tool to be more present during conversations. That is _to clearly understand my unfulfilled needs at the moment_, and see how it impacts my behavior. Some times, at the heat of the moment, I act suboptimally, such as arguing for argument's sake. But when I ask myself what unfulfilled needs drive those behaviors, I realize I am driven by defensiveness, and anger, see the pettiness, and start acting more maturely.

This tool is also very powerful to be more compassionate with others because it puts you into others' shoes immediately. But for this tool to work optimally, you need a good understanding of their contexts prior so that you can properly triangulate what their needs are (I suppose you can ask, but that might not work depending on the relationships), which you can achieve during regular 1:1s.
