Sometimes, things spiral out of control because of, or regardless of what you have done. One day, your company's investor decides to pull their funding, tanking the morale. Another day, two most senior designers quit within a month.

It can be easier on your ego to blame others for causing these problems, and "betraying" your trust. I was doing exactly that a few days ago when I heard the bad news. But then I realized none of these problems are not personal, meaning they did not willfully chose to cause pain to me. So no point in being mad at them.

Self pity or regret does not work either. I can't always choose and surely didn't choose the situation I found myself in. So I stopped seeing these problems personal and started solving the problems, I found myself managing the situation much better. Instead of being overwhelmed with the situation, I looked for what I could do at the moment and started working on them one step at a time: updating the team's job postings, responding to inbound candidates, training newer engineers on the team, and working on the upcoming roadmap. Hopefully, my work will create small wins so the team can withstand this troubling time.
