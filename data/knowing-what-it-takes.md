During a 1:1 with a new team member, he asked me how he could become a better engineer. I told him that it takes time, but less than what you'd expect.

Having an unrealistic expectation, either high or low, is the surest way to fail. For example, if you expect to become a skilled boxer after only 2 weeks of practicing, you will be thoroughly disappointed at the end of those two weeks. On the other hand, if you expect it will take a decade, you will never get started. Basic cost-benefit analysis.

Thus, a reality check on your expectation is critical. Ask people who went down the path before you. Then try on your own, and adjust your expectation.
