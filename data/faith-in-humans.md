I keep two principles in mind when I interact with my coworkers. Those are:

* My coworkers, to the best of their ability, and knowledge, try to create the best possible outcome for the team.
* But they will, as they are humans, make mistakes. (so learn to forgive, and build a safeguard when needed)

Last Thursday, I was reminded of these two principles when I was reading a draft postmortem about a release snafu, written by a junior engineer. It was his first time writing a postmortem and, thus, he attributed the incident to the teammates' recklessness, and irresponsibility. I figured it would be a good opportunity for him to learn more about psychological safety, so we went over [Blamelss Postmortem](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/)Â together and discussed how to think in systems and from different perspectives.

Later that day, I was happy to hear his team resolved the underlying issue (lack of knowledge sharing when releasing) at their retrospective meeting without my involvement. I was lucky to have a team willing to listen, and it was another good day's work.
